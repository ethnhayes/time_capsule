      As of February 2018, there are approximately 660,000 running podcast shows with a total of 28 million indi-vidual episodes. Thats a lot of audio. Who knows what that number will be 10 years from now? (well, you do, the person who found this website, but we don’t). Podcasting sort of gets the short end of the stick, treated like a disposable medium. Many podcasts are forgotten about almost as soon as they’re published. And a lot of podcasts never get ANY listeners at all. Maybe those shows are about something way too specific. Maybe those shows are way too generic. Maybe their creators abandon the project 4 episodes in because turns out they’re not as emotionally invested in their cereal review show as they thought they were gonna be. Or most likely of all, the creators just forget about it themselves. But that’s not fair! These recordings were someone's passion project! These recordings we’re personal to someone at some point. Someone got together with their friends and invested a lot of energy into trying to share their passion for something with the world; re-gardless of how relatable that passion may have been.  A lot of these shows have hundreds of hours worth of episodes, episodes that only a handful of people ever listened to. Our goal is to change that. Podcasts become available April 17, 2019 at 3:00 PM.

I used to be promiscuous, but I'm more of a spinster these days. I'm obsessed with Black Lives Matter, roping people into group art projects, and my nether region. Super Snarky was started with my bff, Lydia the Twattasaurus. We usually start off talking about her twatastic adventures and it always leads us back to politics. Lydia is a 32 year old single mother, who raises her kid with her best friend. She has been a muse for artists and has lived a zany life. I hope we crack you up and make you think about your own stuff a little bit. In ep 1, We talk about the perils of anal, using sex chicken for good, and why women should always be current on the urban dictionary.
